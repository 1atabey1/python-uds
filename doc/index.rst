python-uds
==========

Python-uds is a high level UDS interface for python. It was designed with two purposes in mind:

1. Provide an abstracted UDS interface which is communication protocol agnostic
2. Provide an interface to parse known UDS diagnostic databases (Open Document Exchange, ODX)
   to provide a more human readable interface
